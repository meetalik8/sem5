CHAPTER 1 - DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE: ALICE IS BORED SITTING ON THE RIVERBANK WITH HER SISTER, 
WHEN SHE NOTICES A TALKING, CLOTHED WHITE RABBIT WITH A POCKET WATCH RUN PAST. 
SHE FOLLOWS IT DOWN A RABBIT HOLE WHEN SUDDENLY SHE FALLS A LONG WAY TO A CURIOUS HALL 
WITH MANY LOCKED DOORS OF ALL SIZES. SHE FINDS A SMALL KEY TO A DOOR TOO SMALL FOR HER TO FIT, 
BUT THROUGH WHICH SHE SEES AN ATTRACTIVE GARDEN. SHE THEN DISCOVERS A BOTTLE LABELLED 'DRINK ME', 
THE CONTENTS OF WHICH CAUSE HER TO SHRINK TOO SMALL TO REACH THE KEY. A CAKE WITH 'EAT ME' ON IT CAUSES 
HER TO GROW TO SUCH A TREMENDOUS SIZE HER HEAD HITS THE CEILING.

ALICE COMES UPON A MUSHROOM AND SITTING ON IT IS A BLUE CATERPILLAR SMOKING A HOOKAH. 
THE CATERPILLAR QUESTIONS ALICE AND SHE ADMITS TO HER CURRENT IDENTITY CRISIS, COMPOUNDED BY HER 
INABILITY TO REMEMBER A POEM. BEFORE CRAWLING AWAY, THE CATERPILLAR TELLS ALICE THAT ONE SIDE OF 
THE MUSHROOM WILL MAKE HER TALLER AND THE OTHER SIDE WILL MAKE HER SHORTER. SHE BREAKS OFF TWO PIECES 
FROM THE MUSHROOM. ONE SIDE MAKES HER SHRINK SMALLER THAN EcER, WHILE ANOTHER CAUSES HER NECK TO GROW HIGH INTO THE TREES, 
WHERE A PIGEON MISTAKES HER FOR A SERPENT. WITH SOME EFFORT, ALICE BRINGS HERSELF BACK TO HER USUAL HEIGHT. SHE STUMBLES UPON 
A SMALL ESTATE AND USES THE MUSHROOM TO REACH A MORE APPROPRIATE HEIGHT.
